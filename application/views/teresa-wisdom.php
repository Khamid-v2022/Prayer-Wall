            <p>Mother Teresa, known for her selfless dedication to the poor and needy, left behind profound wisdom that continues to inspire. Her teachings were simple yet powerful, rooted in kindness, compassion, and unconditional love. She believed that small acts of love could change the world, famously saying, "Not all of us can do great things, but we can do small things with great love."</p>
            <p>One of her core principles was to serve others without expecting anything in return. She emphasized that true compassion isn't just about giving material aid but also offering emotional support, a listening ear, and a warm smile. For Mother Teresa, the greatest poverty was the lack of love and understanding. She encouraged people to reach out to those who are marginalized and forgotten, teaching that by serving others, we find meaning and purpose in life.</p>
            <p>Mother Teresa also spoke about the power of forgiveness and inner peace. She urged us to let go of anger, resentment, and judgment, stating, "If we really want to love, we must learn how to forgive." Her message wasn't just about serving others but also about healing ourselves in the process.</p>
            <p>Her wisdom serves as a reminder that even in a world full of challenges, we can all make a difference through compassion, humility, and love. She taught that true wealth is found in the richness of our spirit, and that by giving freely to others, we receive the greatest gift of allâ€”inner peace and fulfillment.
